Hi! 
Today i'll tell you about blockchain. Let's start!

### Blockchain 
Every day we all interact with one another, mostly on the internet. We chat, we buy things, we use services like banks. But how do we know who to trust online, especially if we have never met them but want to deal with them directly? 
Some companies will check who can be trusted or have reviews of products and sellers. But these businesses can also charge expensive fees. We should be able to deal with each other safely without the need for a “middleman” and pay for it. 

### What is Blockchain? 
Blockchain can help with it.
Blockchain is a shared, distributed ledger that make easier the process of recording transactions and tracking assets in a business network.

A blockchain is a growing list of records, called blocks, which are linked using cryptography. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block a timestamp, and transaction data (generally represented as a Merkle tree).

A blockchain is  a time-stamped series of immutable record of data that is managed by cluster of computers not owned by any single entity. Each of these blocks of data (i.e. block) are secured and bound to each other using cryptographic principles (i.e. chain).

### Transaction cycle
This is the most clear and easy to understand overview of the steps in the blockchain.
1 Someone requests a transaction
2 Transaction broadcasted to P2P computers (nodes).
3 Validation, miners verify the transaction.
4 Transactions combined to form a data block.
5 New block added to existing Blockchain.
6 The transaction is complete.

### The Pillars of Blockchain Technology
The three main properties of Blockchain Technology which has helped it gain widespread acclaim are as follows:
1 Decentralization
2 Transparency
3 Immutability


### Decentralization
The decentralized nature of blockchain technology means that it doesn’t rely on a central point of control.

### Transparency 
One of the most interesting and misunderstood concepts in blockchain technology is “transparency.” Some people say that blockchain gives you privacy while some say that it is transparent. Why do you think that happens?
A person’s identity is hidden via complex cryptography and represented only by their public address. So, if you were to look up a person’s transaction history, you will not see “Katia sent 1 ETH” instead you will see “0xf1bhsflkbzzz9vpfyemvwt2tbyct7nzj sent 1 ETH”.
The following snapshot of Ethereum transactions will show you what I mean:

### Immutability
Immutability, in the context of the blockchain, means that once something has been entered into the blockchain, it cannot be tampered with.

### Cryptocurrency
You may know nothing about the blockchain, but you definitely heard about cryptocurrency.
What cryptocurrency do you know?
A cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency that uses cryptography for security. A cryptocurrency is difficult to counterfeit because of this security feature. 
The first blockchain-based cryptocurrency was Bitcoin, which still remains the most popular and most valuable.


### Where you can use blockchain?
The blockchain gives internet users the ability to create value and authenticates digital information. We can use it for e-commerce, healthcare, voting etc.

### Decree No. 8 “On the Development of Digital Economy”
Belarus on road to become IT country. 
Decree No. 8 “On the Development of Digital Economy”  was initiated by a Belarusian entrepreneur Viktor Prokopenya and then was developed by the Belarus High Technologies Park and representatives of the Belarusian IT market.

### Currency.com 
The Currency.com platform helps everyone, who has Bitcoin or Ethereum, to trade financial assets, commodities and indices from the world’s biggest companies. 

### Blockchain Sturt Up Community
Blockchain is popular in Belarus. 
Every tenth startup in the country is developing a project using blockchain technology. 
The guys are engaged in the development of an open source crypto wallet, cryptographic platforms for scientists, certification, games etc.

### Thank you!

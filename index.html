					<h1>Blockchain</h1>
					<aside class="notes">
						Every day we all interact with one another, mostly on the internet. 
						We chat, we buy things, we use services like banks. 
						But how do we know who to trust online, especially if we have never met them but want to deal with them directly? 
						Some companies will check who can be trusted or have reviews of products and sellers. 
						But these businesses can also charge expensive fees. 
						We should be able to deal with each other safely without the need for a “middleman” and pay for it.

					<h3>What is Blockchain?</h3>
					<img src="src/blockchain11.jpg" alt="blockchain" height="500px">
					<aside class="notes">
						Blockchain can help with it.
						Blockchain is a shared, distributed ledger that make easier the process of recording transactions and tracking assets in a business network.
						A blockchain is a growing list of records, called blocks, which are linked using cryptography. 
						Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block a timestamp, and transaction data (generally represented as a Merkle tree).

					<h3>Transaction cycle</h3>
					<img src="src/transactioncycle.jpg" alt="blockchain" height="500px">
					<aside class="notes">
						This is the most clear and easy to understand overview of the steps in the blockchain.
						1 Someone requests a transaction
						2 Transaction broadcasted to P2P computers (nodes).
						3 Validation, miners verify the transaction.
						4 Transactions combined to form a data block.
						5 New block added to existing Blockchain.
						6 The transaction is complete.

						<li class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1">Decentralization</li>
						<li class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2">Transparency</li>
						<li class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3">Immutability</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">
						The three main properties of Blockchain Technology which has helped it gain widespread acclaim are as follows:
						1 Decentralization
						2 Transparency
						3 Immutability
					</aside>

					<h3>Decentralization</h3>
					<img src="src/centradecentra.jpg" alt="decentralization" height="500px">
					<aside class="notes">
						The decentralized nature of blockchain technology means that it doesn’t rely on a central point of control.
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Transparency</h3>
					<img src="src/word-image-53.png" alt="transparency">
					<aside class="notes">
						A person’s identity is hidden via complex cryptography and represented only by their public address. 
						So, if you were to look up a person’s transaction history, you will not see “Katia sent 1 ETN” 
						instead you will see “1MF1bhsFLkBzzz9vpFYEmvwT2TbyCt7NZJ sent 1 ETH”.
						The following snapshot of Ethereum transactions will show you what we mean:

					<h3>Immutability</h3>
					<img src="src/word-image-54-768x218.png" alt="immutability" height="500px">
					<aside class="notes">
						Immutability, in the context of the blockchain, means that 
						once something has been entered into the blockchain, it cannot be tampered with.
					</aside>		
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Cryptocurrency</h3>
					<img src="src/Screenshot_1.png" alt="immutability" height="500px">	
					<aside class="notes">
						A cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency that uses cryptography for security. 
						A cryptocurrency is difficult to counterfeit because of this security feature. 
						The first blockchain-based cryptocurrency was Bitcoin, which still remains the most popular and most valuable.

					<h3>Where you can use blockchain?</h3>
					<img src="src/use.jpeg" alt="immutability" height="500px">	
					<aside class="notes">
						The blockchain gives internet users the ability to create value and authenticates digital information. 
						We can use it for e-commerce, healthcare, voting etc.

						Belarus on road to become IT country. 
						Decree No. 8 “On the Development of Digital Economy”
						The project was initiated by a Belarusian entrepreneur Viktor Prokopenya and 
						then was developed by the Belarus High Technologies Park and representatives of the Belarusian IT market.
